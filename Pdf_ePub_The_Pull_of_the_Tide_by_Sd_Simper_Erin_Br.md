Mermaids, sea witches, selkies, ahoy! Dive into ten tales of sapphic romantasy. Separated by land and sea, two lovers ache with yearning. Can a human and a mermaid really make a life together?

Across the sea, two pirate ex-lovers must work together against a foe trying to steal a goddess&amp;#039;s power. On a seductive island, a swordfish shifter and a human crash together and come apart. Can they piece together their shattered supernatural connection? This gender and identity-inclusive sapphic collection features ten pearl-sized ocean-themed stories of love and adventure on the high seas.
