From the bestselling author of Bush Runner: The Adventures of Pierre Esprit-Radisson This is the story of the collision of two worlds. In the early 1600s, the Jesuitsâ€”the Catholic Churchâ€™s most ferocious warriors for Christâ€”tried to create their own nation on the Great Lakes and turn the Huron (Wendat) Confederacy into a model Jesuit state. At the centre of their campaign was missionary Jean de BrÃ©beuf, a mystic who sought to die a martyr&amp;#039;s death. He lived among a proud people who valued kindness and rights for all, especially women. In the end, Huronia was destroyed. BrÃ©beuf became a Catholic saint, and the Jesuit&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;martyrdom&amp;quot; became one of the founding myths of Canada. In this first secular biography of BrÃ©beuf, historian Mark Bourrie, bestselling author of Bush Runner: The Adventures of Pierre-Esprit Radisson, recounts the missionary&amp;#039;s fascinating life and tells the tragic story of the remarkable people he lived among. Drawing on the letters and documents of the timeâ€”including BrÃ©beuf&amp;#039;s accounts of his bizarre spiritualityâ€”and modern studies of the Jesuits, Bourrie shows how Huron leaders tried to navigate this new world and the people struggled to cope as their nation came apart. Riveting, clearly told, and deeply researched, Crosses in the Sky is an essential addition toâ€”and expansion ofâ€”Canadian history.
