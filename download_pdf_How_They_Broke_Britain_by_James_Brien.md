Something has gone really wrong in Britain.
 ¬†
 Our economy has tanked, our freedoms are shrinking, and social divisions are growing. Our politicians seem most interested in their own careers, and much of the media only make things worse. We are living in a country almost unrecognisable from the one that existed a decade ago. But whose fault is it really? Who broke Britain and how did they do it?
 ¬†
 Bold and incisive as ever, James O&amp;#039;Brien reveals the shady network of influence that has created a broken Britain of strikes, shortages and scandals. He maps the web connecting dark think tanks to Downing Street, the journalists complicit in selling it to the public and the media bosses pushing their own agendas. Over ten chapters, each focusing on a particular person complicit in the downfall, James O&amp;#039;Brien reveals how a select few have conspired - sometimes by incompetence, sometimes by design - to bring Britain to its knees.
