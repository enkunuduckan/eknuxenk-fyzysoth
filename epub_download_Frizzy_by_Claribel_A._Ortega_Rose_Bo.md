Notes From Your Bookseller Frizzy is a heartwarming graphic novel about a young Dominican girl learning to embrace her natural curls. This refreshing read about self-acceptance and individuality is sure to resonate with many young readers. A middle grade graphic novel about Marlene, a young girl who stops straightening her hair and embraces her natural curls.

Marlene loves three things: books, her cool TÃ­a Ruby and hanging out with her best friend Camila. But according to her mother, Paola, the only thing she needs to focus on is school and &amp;quot;growing up.&amp;quot; That means straightening her hair every weekend so she could have &amp;quot;presentable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;good hair&amp;quot;.

 But Marlene hates being in the salon and doesn&amp;#039;t understand why her curls are not considered pretty by those around her. With a few hiccups, a dash of embarrassment, and the much-needed help of Camila and Tia Rubyâ€”she slowly starts a journey to learn to appreciate and proudly wear her curly hair.
